h1. Neo4j module for Puppet

* Developed by "Hendy Irawan":http://www.hendyirawan.com/
* Originally forked from "alfredc/puppet-neo4j":https://github.com/alfredc/puppet-neo4j

This module installs Neo4j as a standalone server.

h2. Requirements

1. @curl@ package
2. @lsof@ packae
3. @openjdk-7-jre-headless@ package or any JRE

h2. Typical Usage

bc. package { curl: ensure => present }
package { lsof: ensure => present }
package { openjdk-7-jre-headless: ensure => present }
class { neo4j: }
Package['openjdk-7-jre-headless'] -> Class['neo4j']

h2. Use Your Own URL

Useful for Vagrant VMs.

bc. class { neo4j:
  release => 'neo4j-community-1.6',
  mirror_url => 'http://33.33.33.1:8081/nexus/service/local/repositories/thirdparty/content/org/neo4j/neo4j-community/1.6/'
}

h2. Open Files Limit (ulimit)

Although the limit has been raised, neo4j may still complain (it's neo4j's bug):

bc. WARNING: Detected a limit of 1024 for maximum open files, while a minimum value of 40000 is recommended.

This is NORMAL.
To check yourself, @sudo su neo4j@ then @ulimit -n@, you'll see 40000.
